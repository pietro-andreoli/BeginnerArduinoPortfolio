# BeginnerArduinoPortfolio
A portfolio of all my beginner Arduino endeavors. Some are developed by me, some are based off examples found online.

Feel free to take as you need from my work. Just please keep my link at the bottom of any schematics you use. Those, while quite simple, were made entirely by me.
